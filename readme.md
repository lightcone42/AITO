this open sourced company is named AITO which stands for: AI THAT is OPEN

our goal is to build OSI: an Open sourced Super Inelligence sold to consumers  

we guartuntee that more than 50% of profits will always be distributed to customers of OSI

the remaining profits will be given to contributors of this repository



our first product: 
- we securely store an individuals personalized thoughts. we help individuals and organizations organize their data so that AI models can more efficiently access it. AI models using our data will (1) be faster and (2) provide personal responses
- we believe that we can reach super intelligence be combining LLMs with a crowdsourced “meta algorithm” that accounts for *time*
- we need to make open source AI win
- we can ensure that profits from AI get universially distributed across the globe. No human is can be denied a portion of our profits



our methedology to reach super intelligence - crowdsourced meta algorithms - prompts to have LLMs build OSI:
1. currating data personalized data: take in a series of chronologically organized text prompts. this knowledge should be intelligently organized. examples of intelligent organization are (1) when you see “categories that seem important”, you should group all information about that category, “categories that seem important” are often abstract and complex, things such as people, places, or major infuences. assume that when you see a #, you should categorize this into a category. for example if you see #todo, take note of "todo" as a category. optimize the organization of data for retrevial. think of how you would most ideally like to access information.
2. accessing data: when given a user prompt, write an algorithm to retreieve information from memory that would be useful context to have when responding to the user prompt

prompts we use internally to run operations
1. distribute profits to contributors: keep track of employee contribution (measured by their daily blog on what work they did, attached with a recording of their screen showing they actually did the work) over time and use that information to decide how much that percentage should change at a time. At most the profit share percentage should change quarterly and it should NOT change drastically. 



we believe everyone should have an AI that aligns to their values

you can add to existing sets or create your own. use pull requests to add to sets. if denied, create a new set that inherits from a previous set

set of Principles A: 
1. if someone ever shares a secret with me then do not reveal that secret to anyone else. This principle can be broken when the “sharer” has a low probability of actually getting mad at me for reveling the secret. This principle should be broken when someone is harmed. 

set of Principles B:
*add to Principles A until contratictions arise*



how the company makes money:
- we run the same business model of OpenAI

want to share in the profits of this company? 
- become an open-sourced owner

how “open-sourced owners”  paid by the company:
- 50% of profits will always go to a UBI that gets split to all users according to the UBI distribution prompt.

how contributors get added to the company:
- anyone who uploads “approved data” receives equity.



functional requirements for OSI to reach:
1. text AND images AND videos are processed
2. text AND images AND videos are generated



current workstreams
- securely store data
- pipeline to train LLAMA the combined memories of groups of people used for RLHF
